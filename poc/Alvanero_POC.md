# PoC — Auto-Trade Bot (Concept Only)

**Author:** alvanero (Discord: 878534291695501372)  
**PR:** https://github.com/SoundnessLabs/testnet-vapps/pull/199
**Category:** defi  
**Status:** PoC submitted (conceptual, due to missing trade feature in Soundness)

## What I proved
- Able to simulate the workflow of Soundness:
  - Prepared a payload (proof_payload.json)
  - "Uploaded" → generated dummy `blob_id`
  - "Submitted" → generated dummy attestation

## IDs (dummy)
- `blob_id`: 0xmockblobid1234567890abcdef  
- `attestation`: 0xmockattestation9876543210fedcba  

## Commands
See `poc/commands.txt`

## Notes
Currently, Soundness testnet does not expose trade endpoints.  
This PoC demonstrates understanding of the pipeline (payload → blob → attestation) and will be extended once trade is available.


## Concept & Workflow — Auto-Trade Bot on Soundness Layer

### 🎯 Goal
The Auto-Trade Bot is designed to automate trading strategies (e.g., grid, arbitrage, DCA) on decentralized exchanges, while making each trade **verifiable and transparent** through the Soundness Layer.  
Even though trading endpoints are not yet available in Soundness testnet, this project provides a clear design plan for when they go live.

### 🛠 Components
1. **Bot Engine (Executor)**  
   Runs predefined strategies and executes trades on testnet DEXs, returning `tx_hash` logs.

2. **Proof Generator**  
   Builds a proof for every trade including:
   - Trading pair, side, and amount  
   - On-chain `tx_hash`  
   - Timestamp and strategy metadata  

   Example :

   {
  "pair": "SUI/USDC",
  "side": "BUY",
  "amount": "25",
  "tx_hash": "0x123...",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-07T03:20:00Z",
  "strategy": "grid-v1"
}


3. **Walrus Storage**  
   Uploads the proof and returns a **`blob_id`** as a permanent reference.

4. **Soundness CLI**  
   Submits the `blob_id` to the Soundness Layer, which generates an **attestation** to confirm validity.

5. **Dashboard / Explorer / Discord Bot**  
   Publishes the attestations so that any user can independently verify the bot’s trades.

---

### 🔄 Workflow
1. Bot executes a trade → get `tx_hash`.  
2. Proof Generator creates a JSON payload (`proof_payload.json`).  
3. Payload is uploaded to Walrus → returns `blob_id`.  
4. `blob_id` is submitted with Soundness CLI → returns **attestation**.  
5. Attestation is displayed in a dashboard or Discord bot for transparency.

---

### ✅ Value Proposition
- **Transparency:** Every trade has a verifiable proof.  
- **Auditability:** Users and investors can confirm the bot’s activity.  
- **Composability:** Other DeFi projects can consume attestations as inputs.  
- **Future-Ready:** Ready to be extended once Soundness enables direct trading features.

---
###👤 How Users Use It

Configure Strategy:
User provides parameters (pair, amount, thresholds).

Run the Bot:
Bot executes automatically (e.g., every X minutes).

View Trade Records:
Users open the dashboard/Discord to see:

Each trade result

Proof payloads

Verified attestations

Trust but Verify:
Instead of trusting logs printed by the bot, users rely on attestations from Soundness Layer, which cannot be faked by the bot developer.

✨ In short:

For the trader → the bot gives automation.

For the community → Soundness Layer gives verifiable transparency of each trade.
